# Introduction

On the daily use of the *Pomodoro Technique (R)*, I prefer to use a pencil and a diary for task tracking. Handwriting all of that allows me to be more conscious of pending things to do.

So, I was looking for a simple timer for this technique, including some features that are boring to do with pencil and paper, like record diary statistics of finished pomodoris and interruptions and not much more.

Most of the best software tools found for this technique available, include functionality that makes the UI more complex or distractive, like TO-DO lists, tasks categories and lots of options I do not want to be present there. Or, in the other extreme, are just too simple.

As couldn't find what I needed, I implemented this one.



# Download

Checkout the most recent release [here](https://github.com/mmazzei/Pomodorin/releases).



# Usage

The UI target is to be simple and clear. If you always click at the big image in the center, it will do what you need most of the time.


## How to start a new pomodori?

You can click on the big tomato button:

  ![Main view](readmeAssets/mainScreen.png)

If you just finished a break, the following window will be shown:

![Deciding next step](readmeAssets/decideWhatIsNext_tomato.png)

That could be different, depending on your current session, because Pomodorin will recommend you the next step, making that button bigger than the alternatives. So, if you just finished a pomodori, that window will look like:

![Deciding next step](readmeAssets/decideWhatIsNext_shortBreak.png)

It doesn't matter if small or big, the tomato button starts a pomodori.


## How to start a break?

Just by clicking on the hourglass buttons.

Short break:

Long break:

## How to stop a pomodori or break?

The small "-" button at the bottom of the screen is what you want.


## How to automatically start pomodoris and breaks?

There is an *experimental* feature to do so: **Auto-mode**.

When Pomodorin is running in Auto-mode, it will automatically start the next pomodori, short break or long break, depending on your previous actions.

You can activate that by clicking the small lock icon at the bottom of the screen.

If you close the Pomodorin application, the next pomodori or break will not be automatically started until you open it again.


# FAQ

## What is the meaning of the version name?

"A mi me anda" is a common software developer excuse. The meaning in english is: "It works for me".

If you are a programmer and need some ideas for your excuses, there is a nice site that can be helpful for you: [programmingexcuses.com](http://programmingexcuses.com).

If you are not a programmer, do as if you never read this part. We do not invent excuses, those phrases are true comments from the soul!


## Why is this page, the code and the UI are so badly written?

English is not my main language (good excuse!). Hope to have a collaborator to improve this in order to remove this question from here.


## How do you do to have a FAQ if there are no users yet?

Ok, I invented the questions to fill some space here.

Was either that or sit and write the next awesome Pomodorin feature.


## Why is the Pomodorin application so bad?

This is not the final version yet, it is in alpha status. It lacks features and has plenty of bugs.
